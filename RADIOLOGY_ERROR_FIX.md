# 🔧 Radiology Analysis Error Fix - Complete

## ✅ **Error Fixed**: `name 'scan_type' is not defined`

The error has been successfully resolved! The issue was that the `scan_type` parameter wasn't being properly passed through all the method calls in the radiology dynamic insights service.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The error occurred in the `_get_fallback_radiology_keywords` method which was trying to use `scan_type` but it wasn't passed as a parameter. This caused a `NameError` when the method tried to access the undefined variable.

## 🛠️ **Changes Made**

### 1. **Updated Method Signature**
```python
# Before (causing error)
def _get_fallback_radiology_keywords(self, finding: str, recommendations: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Any]:

# After (fixed)
def _get_fallback_radiology_keywords(self, finding: str, recommendations: List[str], scan_type: str = "chest_xray") -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

### 2. **Updated Method Calls**
Updated all calls to `_get_fallback_radiology_keywords` to pass the `scan_type` parameter:

```python
# Fixed calls
immediate_keywords = self._get_fallback_radiology_keywords(primary_finding, recommendations, scan_type)
```

### 3. **Updated Related Methods**
Also updated `_extract_radiology_keywords` method to properly handle the `scan_type` parameter.

## ✅ **Verification Results**
