# ü©ª RADIOLOGY API INTEGRATION SETUP

## ‚úÖ **GROQ, Tavily, and Keyword AI Added to Radiology Analysis**

I've successfully integrated all three APIs into the radiology analysis system. Here's what's been added and how to set it up:

## üîß **What's Been Added**

### **1. GROQ Integration**
- **Purpose**: Generate AI-powered medical explanations
- **Output**: Detailed, patient-friendly explanations of radiology findings
- **Features**: 
  - Summary of findings
  - Clinical explanation
  - Significance interpretation
  - Confidence and urgency explanations

### **2. Tavily Integration**
- **Purpose**: Fetch trusted medical resources
- **Output**: Relevant medical articles from trusted sources
- **Sources**: RadiologyInfo.org, Mayo Clinic, NIH, ACR, American Lung Association
- **Features**:
  - Condition-specific articles
  - High relevance scoring
  - Trusted medical domains only

### **3. Keyword AI Integration**
- **Purpose**: Extract and categorize medical keywords
- **Output**: Organized medical terminology
- **Categories**:
  - Conditions (pneumonia, cardiomegaly, etc.)
  - Symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath)
  - Treatments (antibiotic therapy, surgery)
  - Procedures (chest x-ray, CT scan, biopsy)
  - General (medical evaluation, healthcare)

## üîë **API Keys Setup**

### **Step 1: Get API Keys**

#### **GROQ API Key**
1. Go to [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
2. Sign up/login
3. Create new API key
4. Copy the key

#### **Tavily API Key**
1. Go to [tavily.com](https://tavily.com)
2. Sign up for developer account
3. Get API key from dashboard
4. Copy the key

#### **Keyword AI Key**
1. Go to [keywordai.co](https://keywordai.co)
2. Sign up for API access
3. Get API key from account settings
4. Copy the key

### **Step 2: Set Environment Variables**

Create or update your `.env` file in the backend directory:

```bash
# API Keys for Enhanced Analysis
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
KEYWORD_AI_KEY=your_keyword_ai_key_here

# Existing keys
# ... other environment variables
```

### **Step 3: Restart Backend**
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## üéØ **What You'll See Now**

### **Enhanced AI Insights Tab**
```
ü©ª AI Radiology Summary
"Pneumonia detected with 78% confidence. This indicates an infection or 
inflammation in the lung tissue that appears as areas of increased density 
on the X-ray. The urgent urgency level reflects the need for prompt medical 
attention and likely antibiotic treatment."

üìö Clinical Explanation
"Pneumonia appears on chest X-rays as areas of increased whiteness in the 
lung fields, representing fluid, pus, or inflammatory cells filling the 
air spaces. This can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or other organisms..."

üè• Clinical Significance
"Pneumonia typically requires antibiotic treatment for bacterial causes, 
supportive care for viral pneumonia, and close monitoring for complications. 
Early treatment generally leads to good outcomes..."

üìä Analysis Interpretation
Confidence Level: High confidence indicates findings clearly visible...
Urgency Assessment: Urgent urgency indicates findings requiring prompt...
```

### **Enhanced Learn More Tab**
```
üìÑ Medical Articles
‚Ä¢ Understanding Pneumonia: Radiology Overview (RadiologyInfo.org)
‚Ä¢ Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (Mayo Clinic)
‚Ä¢ Chest X-ray Interpretation Guidelines (American College of Radiology)
‚Ä¢ Lung Health and Pneumonia Prevention (American Lung Association)
```

### **Enhanced Key Terms Tab**
```
üè∑Ô∏è Medical Keywords

ü©ª Conditions
pneumonia | lung infection | pulmonary infection | consolidation

ü´Å Symptoms  
chest pain | shortness of breath | cough | fever

üíä Treatments
antibiotic therapy | respiratory support | medical monitoring

üî¨ Procedures
chest x-ray | sputum culture | blood tests | clinical examination

üìã General
pulmonary health | medical imaging | diagnostic radiology | healthcare
```

## üß™ **Testing the Integration**

### **With API Keys (Full Experience)**
1. **Set up API keys** in `.env` file
2. **Restart backend**
3. **Upload chest X-ray**
4. **Check backend logs** for:
   ```
   INFO: GROQ client initialized for radiology
   INFO: Tavily API key loaded for radiology  
   INFO: Keyword AI key loaded for radiology
   INFO: Radiology analysis enhanced with GROQ, Tavily, and Keyword AI
   ```
5. **Verify enhanced content** in all tabs

### **Without API Keys (Fallback)**
- System works normally with mock data
- Backend logs show warnings about missing keys
- Frontend still shows enhanced results from immediate insights

## ‚úÖ **Expected Behavior**

### **Backend Logs (Success)**
```
INFO: GROQ client initialized for radiology
INFO: Tavily API key loaded for radiology
INFO: Keyword AI key loaded for radiology
INFO: Enhancing radiology analysis for: Pneumonia
INFO: Radiology analysis enhanced successfully
```

### **Backend Logs (Fallback)**
```
WARNING: GROQ_API_KEY not found
WARNING: TAVILY_API_KEY not found  
WARNING: KEYWORD_AI_KEY not found
INFO: Using mock analysis (install PyTorch for AI functionality)
```

## üéâ **Result**

**The radiology analysis now has the same comprehensive API integration as skin analysis:**

- ‚úÖ **GROQ**: AI-powered medical explanations
- ‚úÖ **Tavily**: Trusted medical resources  
- ‚úÖ **Keyword AI**: Organized medical terminology
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Frontend**: All tabs show rich, condition-specific content
- ‚úÖ **Fallback Support**: Works even without API keys

## üîß **Technical Details**

### **Files Modified/Created:**
- `backend/app/services/radiology_api_integration.py` - New dedicated service
- `backend/app/routes/radiology_optimized.py` - Updated to use new service
- Enhanced response format with `ai_summary`, `medical_resources`, `keywords`

### **API Integration Features:**
- **Concurrent API calls** for fast response
- **10-second timeout** to prevent hanging
- **Error handling** with graceful fallbacks
- **Structured responses** optimized for frontend
- **Domain-specific queries** for relevant results

**Set up your API keys and restart the backend to see the full enhanced radiology analysis experience!** ü©ª‚ú®
