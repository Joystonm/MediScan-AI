    "summary": "**Medical Summary: Skin Analysis Results**\n\nBased on the skin analysis, our top prediction is a benign keratosis, which is a type of non-cancerous skin growth. This growth is typically harmless and may appear as a small, rough patch on the skin.\n\n**Confidence Level:**\nThe confidence level of 65.0% indicates that while our analysis suggests a benign keratosis, there is still a possibility that the growth may be something else. This level of confidence is moderate, and a professional medical evaluation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nThe risk level is classified as MEDIUM, indicating that while the growth is likely benign, it is still important to have it evaluated by a healthcare professional to rule out any potential complications or underlying conditions.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nWe recommend that you schedule an appointment with a dermatologist or healthcare provider to have the growth evaluated and diagnosed. They will perform a physical examination, take a biopsy if necessary, and provide guidance on the best course of treatment. It is essential to have a professional medical evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any potential risks.\n\n**Medical Disclaimer:**\nPlease note that this analysis is AI-assisted and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis or treatment decisions. A professional medical evaluation is required to confirm the diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan. If you have any concerns or questions, please consult with a qualified healthcare provider.",
    "explanation": "**What is Benign Keratosis?**\n\nBenign keratosis is a common, non-cancerous skin growth that appears as a small, rough patch or bump on the skin. It is also known as a seborrheic keratosis, which is a type of benign tumor that develops from skin cells.\n\n**Common Characteristics:**\n\n* Benign keratoses typically appear as small, brown or black spots or patches on the skin\n* They can occur anywhere on the body, but are most common on the face, neck, and back\n* They are usually small, ranging from 1-10 mm in diameter\n* They may be flat or raised, and can have a rough or smooth surface\n* They are usually asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause discomfort or pain\n\n**Typical Causes or Risk Factors:**\n\n* Benign keratoses are more common with age, and are most likely to occur in people over 40\n* They are also more common in people with fair skin\n* Some research suggests that exposure to the sun may play a role in the development of benign keratoses\n* Family history may also be a factor, as some people may be more prone to developing benign keratoses due to their genetic makeup\n\n**General Prognosis:**\n\n* Benign keratoses are not cancerous and do not typically cause any harm\n* They do not usually cause discomfort or pain, and do not require treatment unless they become irritated or inflamed\n* In rare cases, benign keratoses may become irritated or inflamed, which can cause redness, itching, or bleeding\n\n**Why Medical Evaluation is Important:**\n\n* While benign keratoses are not typically a cause for concern, it is still important to have them evaluated by a healthcare professional\n* A healthcare professional can confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other skin conditions that may have similar appearances\n* In some cases, benign keratoses may",
