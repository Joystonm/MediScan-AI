🧠 AI Medical Summary
"Basal Cell Carcinoma detected with 57% confidence. This is the most 
common form of skin cancer that grows slowly and rarely spreads to 
other parts of the body. While it's considered moderate risk, early 
treatment prevents complications and ensures the best cosmetic outcome. 
BCC typically appears as a pearly or waxy bump, a flat flesh-colored 
lesion, or a bleeding sore that heals and returns."

📚 Condition Explanation
"Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) develops in the basal cells of the skin's 
outer layer, typically in sun-exposed areas. It's the most frequently 
occurring form of all cancers, with over 4 million cases diagnosed in 
the U.S. each year. BCC rarely metastasizes (spreads) but can cause 
significant local damage if left untreated. The good news is that when 
detected early, BCC has a cure rate of over 95% with appropriate treatment."

📊 Analysis Interpretation
Confidence Level: Good confidence (57%) shows reasonable certainty in 
the assessment, with professional confirmation recommended for definitive 
diagnosis.

Risk Assessment: Medium risk indicates features that warrant professional 
evaluation within a reasonable timeframe to ensure proper diagnosis and care.
