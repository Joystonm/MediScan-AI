## 🎯 **Enhanced Output Example**

### **AI Insights Section**
```
🤖 AI Insights
Cardiomegaly identified with 82.0% confidence on chest xray. This is 
enlargement of the heart shadow, indicating the heart is larger than normal. 
The follow-up classification suggests comprehensive cardiac evaluation is 
needed to determine the underlying cause.

Medical Explanation:
Cardiomegaly appears as an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest imaging, 
typically with a cardiothoracic ratio greater than 50% on PA chest X-ray. 
It can result from various conditions including heart failure, valve disease, 
cardiomyopathy, hypertension, or pericardial effusion.

Confidence Assessment: High confidence (82.0%) - The AI model shows strong 
certainty based on clear imaging features.
